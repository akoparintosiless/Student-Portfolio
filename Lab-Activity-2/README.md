Laboratory Activity #2 — Working with Analog Signals
Objectives

- Explore analog signals in Arduino circuits.

- Understand analog-to-digital manipulation using the map() function.

Description

This activity builds on Activity #1 by using analogWrite() to control LED brightness and implementing logic with arrays and loops.

Circuit Details

- Same setup with LEDs on pins 8–12.

- PWM capable pins used to vary brightness.

Logic

- Running light pattern like Activity #1.

- Instead of only turning LEDs on/off — LED brightness gradually changes via PWM.

- Uses while() loop and an array to manage pin modes and movements.

Usage

Upload the provided sketch to your Arduino to demonstrate PWM analog control on multiple LEDs.
