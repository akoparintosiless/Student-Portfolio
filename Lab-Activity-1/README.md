Laboratory Activity #1 — Working with Digital Signals

Objectives

Review Arduino as a device for IoT systems implementation.

Discuss digital signals and their implementation in an Arduino circuit.

Description

In this activity, we created a running light circuit using an Arduino and several LEDs. The program demonstrates how digital signals are used to turn LEDs on and off.

Circuit Details

5 LEDs connected to digital pins 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

Each LED is controlled using digitalWrite().

Logic

Turn on LEDs one by one from pin 12 down to pin 8.

Then turn off LEDs one by one from pin 12 down to pin 8.

A 1-second delay is used between each action.

Usage

Compile and upload the sketch to your Arduino.

The LEDs will blink in a running pattern demonstrating digital write control.
