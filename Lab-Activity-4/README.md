Laboratory Activity #4 — Arduino Serial Connection

Objectives

- Understand Arduino Serial communication.

- Practice using Serial functions to control circuits.

Description

This activity expands on Activity #3 by introducing serial input control.

Instructions

- Choose one sensor (thermistor or photoresistor).

- Monitor its threshold.

- If threshold is met:

  - Blink LED on pin 8 with a fast delay (delay(100)).

  - Continue blinking even after threshold drops.

- Serial control:

  - Typing "stop" (case-insensitive) in the Serial Monitor stops blinking.
