Laboratory Activity #7 — Arduino Control via FastAPI
Objectives

- Implement Serial communication using Python + FastAPI.

- Control Arduino via HTTP API.

Description

Arduino listens for inbound serial commands to toggle LEDs. FastAPI exposes endpoints to send those serial commands.

Components

- Similar setup with 3 LEDs and 3 buttons

FastAPI Endpoints

| Endpoint       | Action       |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| `/led/<color>` | Toggle LED   |
| `/led/on`      | Turn all ON  |
| `/led/off`     | Turn all OFF |

Color Mapping:

- red → 1

- green → 2

- blue →
